## 10/26/2025 11:24 AM - Setting Up and learning XIAO  



At the beginning, I wanted to understand what I was going to create. I checked how the XIAO microcontroller works, what components I would need, and how the project would turn out.

It took me more time because I wanted to do it properly. I also learned Fusion 360 and KiCad to avoid making mistakes.

## 10/26/2025 11:25 AM - Making PCB  

Once I knew what to start with, I began creating the PCB. I encountered a few problems along the way, but I managed to complete it successfully. I liked it because I was learning industrial automation

## 10/26/2025 11:27 AM - Keyboard Case Design  

The next step was creating the keyboard case. It took me a lot of time, as the biggest challenge was calculating the distances to make everything fit perfectly. Finally, I managed to complete it after six hours. It was worth it â€” everything worked out, and I also expanded my knowledge in Fusion 360.

## 10/28/2025 - Recreating The PCB  

Since I received information that I need to modify my board, I'm adding a few more things. These will be additional buttons from 4 to 9 and an EC11 encoder. It took me a while to understand how the diodes work because I wanted the buttons to be combinable![Zrzut ekranu 2025-10-28 083100](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjE3MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--f1ea8f39141a98db035a445c1b377c62903c878d/Zrzut%20ekranu%202025-10-28%20083100.png)



_My work went faster because I knew how to use the program_  

## 10/29/2025 6 PM - Remaking a keyboard case  

This part took me a very long time (along with the tears over failed measurements). It was a big challenge for me, but luckily I managed to design everything well.

## 10/29/2025 9 PM - Programming Filmware  

That was the easiest thing. I love programming; it's fun. I didn't have too many problems. I used the KMK library to program the keyboard. NGL the hardest thing was writing out the pins
